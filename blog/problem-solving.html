    <h3>Why do we need them in coding?</h3>
    </div>

      <p><strong>Why??? my code is perfect.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p>Have you ever stared at your code wondering, <strong>why isn't it working? </strong>It looks perfect and should work...in my head it works...maybe my laptop's broken...or maybe it just doesn't work because you bombed out coding it...Hello!!! that's me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Luckily there are a few techniques we can do before closing the lid of your laptop in the hope that when you open it, your well written code works and the unicorns are running on rainbows again. No...unicorns don't run they fly as they have wings.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm seriously not gonna talk too much about any of the Kata exercises. Apart from the 1st two, I didn't solve any of the rest on my own. I had no idea how to solve those...not proud moments. What I learn't from these were I am shit at coding. Still have hope tho haha.</p>

    <h3>My Problem and How I solved it.</h3>
    </div>

      <p>My problem was one of my own in the JavaScript Methods challenge: To search a playlist for a specific artist and if the artist existed or not, each would provide a different message.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I wrote down my steps in plain english then googled a range of methods to use. I wrote some code, console logged, read error messages a few times, spoke to my laptop with kind words before it worked. Sufficient to complete the exercise...that was a proud moment(high fives with my moko's that time). Did I stop there??? NO...I made another problem for myself as I also wanted to search for the artist ignoring whether I entered upper or lowercase. This was my own stretch challenge.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With this stretch challenge I also googled other methods, wrote my steps, console logged, read the error messages alot, spoke to my laptop with even kinder words then finally with a little tear in my eye the darn thing worked...do I need to explain how the high fives were that time...there were B-I-G high-fives with my moko's.</p>
      <br>
    <div class = "single-column">
    <h3>What I learn't.</h3>
    </div>
      <p>What I learn't after this stretch challenge was: If, what I have done was sufficient to complete a task then stop...just stop. Stop creating another problem, just leave it. That's what I'd say to someone else but if something's broken, I gotta try fix it.</p>

      <p>I used a few of the techniques below this week to try solve my coding problems. Oh boy...did I need them.</p>
    
    <div class = "single-column">
      <ul class = "ul-list">
        <p class = "textBox">Pseudocode</p>
        <li>Writing down what I needed to accomplish the problem.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">The rubber ducky method</p>
        <li>Speaking out about my problem to someone instead of asking 'uncle google' or 'a rubber ducky'.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Reading error messages</p> 
        <li>Error messages helped to re-think what I was coding wrong.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Console.logging</p>
        <li>Helped to check on my progress.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Googling</p>
        <li>Googling is my usual, sometimes overwhelming with 'too much' information. 'Information overload'.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Trying something</p>
        <li>Sometimes reading my own code helped me see my own coding errors. I found, having-a-go gave me more understanding.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Asking your peers for help</p>
        <li>Always good to ask your peers, even if they don't know the answer sometimes talking to them sparks an idea or a memory.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Asking coaches for help</p>
        <li>Coaches/Tutors/Facilitators etc are an excellent 'go-to'. They will know a solution, guide you to a solution or point to where there are errors.</li>
        <br>
        <p class = "textBox">Improving your process with reflection</p>
        <li>Reflecting is a good way to unwind from the trauma of learning something new...like JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
