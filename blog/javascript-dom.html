    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p><strong>What is JavaScript you ask?</strong></p>
    <p>At the beginning of this week. My introduction to JavaScript was 'very interesting'. That's saying it 
      nicely.</p>
      <br>
      <p><em>This is how I felt...Fun times!!!.</em></p>

    <div class="imgContainer">

    </div>

      <p>My intention now, is to give my analogy of JavaScript and the relationship it has with HTML and CSS. 
        In the briefest and simplest way I can. <em>What the...</em></p>
    
      <p>JavaScript is what I would call <strong>"the strings" </strong>that when pulled, can modify, change and delete elements within HTML 
        and CSS by manipulating the DOM. The DOM<em>(Document Object Model)</em> is, in my analogy <strong>"the puppet master", </strong>
        which is a built-in object that has many properties and methods that we can use to manipulate the content, style and the stucture of a webpage.</p>
      <p>Below is an image of some elements that is within a webpage. The DOM('Document') is the puppet master but can be manipulated and that is where 
        JavaScript('the lines') step in. JavaScript is useful when you have lines of text with elements and would like to manipulate either one or a 
        few elements of a webpage. Instead of scrolling through the lines and changing each element you can write a script to do it for you. Sounds easy...🤣🤣🤣</p>

    <h3>JavaScript's relationship with HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p><strong>Hold on what's this HTML and CSS stuff I speak of???</strong> They're little magical fairies that show you, the user, 
        all of what you see on a Webpage. Like what you are viewing now. This is my Webpage and I intend to include a bit of what I've learnt over these 3 weeks.<em>(ok be gentle on the 
        critism, if you push the Home at the top you can see the difference. Once your done come back to JavaScript-DOM).<p>
      <p>What you see is some words all in black, an incredibly frustrated monkey, a few pictures and a background picture 
        of stars(it was Matariki week when I began 3 weeks ago, hence the stars).</p>
      <p>Looks quite good doesn't it<em>(Again, I kindly remind you to be gentle with your criticism, I'm fragile 🤣).</em>
        This page was created with plain text in a text-editor<em>(Seriously, I'm not lying). </em></p>
      <hr>
      <p>Lets take a look at a couple of pictures.<em>(A picture says a thousand words).</em>I love pictures.</p>
    
    <!-- 2 x images with captions -->
    <div class="imgContainer">
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/blog3images/HTML8.png" alt="HTML code" title="HTML code written in plain text used within this page">
      <figcaption>html code(the structure) used for this webpage. this is saved as a .html file</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/blog3images/CSS8.png" alt="CSS code" title="CSS code written in plain text, which is used to put some style into this page">
      <figcaption>css code(the styling) used for this webpage. this is saved as a .css file</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Okay the text is not so plain to read, not like a book but does tell a story.<em>(I'm beginning to understand 'What the...' and I hope you are too).</em></p>
    <hr>
    <p>Here is what my Webpage would look like without CSS(the styling).</p>
    
    <div class="imgContainer">
      <figure>
      <img src="../images/blog3images/HTML without CSS1.png" alt="Webpage without CSS" title="My Webpage looks pretty plain without some added colour and structure ">
      <figcaption>an html page without css. apart from the frustrated monkey there is no other styling to this page. that's because i included the image in the html file.</figcaption>

    <p><strong>Now with all the fun stuff out of the way, back to the question.</strong></p>

    
    <h3>Javascript's relationship with HTML and CSS</h3>

    <p>The relationship between these three amigo's requires some knowledge of all. JavaScript would not even know the HTML and CSS exists without the DOM. 
      The DOM is made up of Nodes and Objects, these nodes and objects have elements. As I've mentioned above, the DOM enables JavaScript to manipulate 
      elements within the HTML and CSS files to modify, change and delete elements by accessing the DOM's nodes and objects.<em>(sorry a bit overkill with 
        'the DOM' but sounds like 'the DON' a mafia boss 🤣🤣🤣).</em> 
    </p>
    <p><strong>How does JavaScript access elements within a webpage?</strong></p>
    <p>By creating a function. A <strong>Function</strong> is a set of statements that performs a task(like changing the font-size) or calculating a value
      (like adding some numbers). To qualify as a function it needs a beginning, middle and end. A name, a list of parameters and what you want out of it.</p>
      
    <p><em>Example: If I wanted to know how many AC/DC songs I have in my playlist(that's a long list).</em>How would I access my playlist to find out how many AC/DC songs I have in it? 
      I could go through and physically count each song(hell no...too many)
      or create a JavaScript function to do it for me. How would JavaScript know to count them all and not just one? I would create an array, which would group <strong>all</strong> 
      my AC/DC songs together.(Thank goodness I don't need to do that). Which brings me to the next bit of information.</p>
    <p><strong>Arrays and Objects.</strong> <em>Arrays</em> will group entities with same type e.g AC/DC being type and the songs being the items attached. <em>Objects</em> are single entities with 
      named properties. e.g a container is an object that has properties of height, width, color etc.
    </p>
    <p>Everyday I listen to songs in my playlist, I make a playlist out of my playlist. Since beginning study the music is even louder to help me. Each playlist
      serves it's purpose. I got the angry music when I can't get JavaScript to work, I got the happy music when it does. Depending on what playlist I'm playing expresses how I'm 
      feeling.<em>(That's my Control Flow and Loop example).</em>Right now Thunderstruck is on...so it's happy times as I think I've covered everything in this blog.

<!-- 
1. An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
2. Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
5. Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.  -->
