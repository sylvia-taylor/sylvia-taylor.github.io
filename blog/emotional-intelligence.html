    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

    <p>EQ is an assessment of not only your own but also others emotions. Like constantly 'checking' yourself: 
       <ul>
        <li>Are you showing empathy to others?</li>
        <li>Are you listening and understanding the person who is talking?</li>
        <li>Does your body language reflect what your words are saying?</li>
        <li>Are you being kind to yourself?</li>
      </ul> 
        So many things to consider whilst engaging with others and living your own life.

      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>

      <p>As above EQ is more how we deal with personal life occasions and 
        how we deal with others. IQ is more a test of one's intelligence. We may be able to 
        fix material things but can not fix your life or anyone else's. E.g I may 
        be a genius but pretty much a unemotional cold-stone when it comes to dealing with others.
        Or I could be a social butterfly and not be able solve a puzzle. </p>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence is what makes us human. In our private lives we tend to 
        our loved ones both physically and emotionally without hesitation. I, myself sure 
        don't like to see my loved ones hurting and will try to help them through 
        what ever it is. I will also help someone on the side of the road who has a flat tyre or 
        people who fighting I will put myself in danger to help(not using my IQ but using EQ). Sitting back and letting someone
        go through struggles or aiding in their struggles is not human that's acting like an animal.
         Some have more emotional intelligence than others, as we see in our world everyday. Some 
        will help while others sit back and do nothing. I guess that is their own Emotional Intelligence.
