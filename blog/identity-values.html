      <h1>My Identity and Values</h1>

      <!-- <div class="single-column" style="background-color: lightgray;"> -->
        <p>
          Hi everyone, I'm Sylvia. I live in Gisborne. Lived here for 28 years.

          <h5>What have I been thinking about in terms of values and identity?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          What I value the most is the time I spend with my 5 moko's and watching them grow...
          love those lil humans 😍 . Also value my attitude towards "life's struggles" I 
          always believe I can do it even when the universe has dropped a bomb on my head. 
          I just think get on with it. So my identity is to do everything with integrity and 
          to get on with it.

          <h5>Why am I attending Dev Academy?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Someone mentioned this course to me and being quite an introverted Maori woman I 
          thought "this is perfect it suits my personality, I can hide behind a screen 🙂 ". 
          Also I actually really enjoyed coding back in the day (15yrs ago). I have forgotten 
          alot but somewhere in my brain the light will be turned on again and I will remember...
          and maybe I get to have another crack at making something of it this time 🙂

        <p>Thanks everyone. Ka kite</p>
