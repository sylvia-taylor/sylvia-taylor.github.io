    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
      <p>Also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a brain that is forever changing. 
        The more times the brain is stimulated to learn something that you otherwise wouldn't have, makes the brain stronger and more efficient. 
        Practicing something that's new makes it permanent in your brain. Practice Practice Practice.
      </p>
      <p>When people stop practising new things, the network connecting different parts of the brain will eventually eliminate, or"prune," the connecting cells that formed the pathways.

    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
      <p>A person with a Growth Mindset understands and believes that with extra time and effort you can get smarter. The will to learn something new is enough to stimulate the brain to continuously grow and want to learn more.
      </p> 
      <p>A person with a Fixed Mindset is where your mindset restricts you because of your understanding and belief's e.g. I'm not good at maths so I can't become an accountant or I'm not doing JavaScript because I'm not clever and it's too hard.</p>
      <p>Instead a person with a Growth Mindset would say something like I may not be great at maths but I can learn or JavaScript maybe hard for me at the moment but with practice I'll get better at it.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>In short. The more you learn the more your brain grows.</p>

<!-- 
Research Neuroplasticity

1. Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
2. Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
3. What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

Research Growth Mindset

1. Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
2. In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
3. How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
4. Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
5. Blend with your learning plan and strategies

Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. -->
