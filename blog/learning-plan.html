      <h5>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h5>
      </p>
      <p>
      My long term goal has always been to work in an industry where I enjoy. I have worked in many different industries that have taken care of the bills and 
      habits etc but soon got bored and moved on, Hence why I had many lol. I have always liked anything computer or mechanical related. I was around 
      when the Commodore 64's were the one thing I wanted to concur. I was amazed at how I could make it count by a few lines of code. 
      I was 11yrs old <em>shame I'm sharing my age lol.</em>

        <h5>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h5>
      </p>
      <p>
      My learning strengths are I will overcome and rise above my <em>'lack of knowledge'</em> of areas I am unsure of. I keep researching or practicing 
      until <strong>'I get it'</strong> or at least can comprehend what is being asked.
      I don't really have many limitations <em>(apart from sitting naked while studying...hell no lol)</em>. My limitations are only as bad as I let them be.
      I get myself out of the rabbit hole when I've exhausted all other avenues.
      I admit when I am wrong and admit if I'm truly stuck on something, that's only after I've researched and practiced all I can and I still don't get it.

        <h5>3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
        Communicating clearly is a skill I lack badly. I'm not a word person. I can read and spell but words are boring I guess, have not been great 
        at comprehending anything I read. I have to do it to understand. I could read the whole dictionary over and over and still not remember what anything means.
        I'm not a small talker, can't talk to just anyone. Have been called a snob lol, but that doesn't phase me, my attitude is big enough to handle. Me getting 
        out of my comfort zone is me participating in a group discussion. A group discussion with video <em>'oh god help me'.</em>
        
        I would recommend my introverted self to go away lol. I am a deep thinker and do prefer working alone, and in another sense I love helping people but cannot 
        accept help myself. 
          
        So my personal development would be to ask others for help and to get over not knowing the meaning of words in the dictionary. That's why we have google 
        he can help me with my words.

        4.1 An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives

      <p>
        My commitment to study is to do what ever it takes to overcome my fears of failing. I will stay up late studying, I will live on coffee while studying. 
        This may not be ideal or safe for others but I'm quite used to having a few hours sleep to function and the one's around me are still breathing. It's 15 weeks of <em>hell</em> learning and that's how I will get through it :).

          <h5>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
        From what I see is that the quickest and efficient way to seek help is in 
        the Discord channels. But because I can also see the amount of other students 
        asking for help I choose to 'google it' and help myself.

          What I expect from our Facilitation team is continue on what you're doing. 
          I read the discord channels and you all are so very helpful and have so much knowledge. 
          I have no expectations from you guys, you guys are amazing.

          <p>
          I watched over my sick moko this week and had doctor appointments for the last 2 weeks but I intend to have this core part of the course completed to complete sprint-2.
          I have no scheduled block-out times, It's random I could be on moko pick-up or there could be doctor appointments. Depends on the day. No way will I let normal life 
          occurrences stop me from completing study.
