    <div class="mColumn">

      <p>Below are the questions that were asked and I have answered as briefly and honestly as possible:</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
        
        <p>I have learnt that knowing who I am is greater than knowing what I can or can't do.</p>
        <p>My participation in group discussions with video <strong>'ON'</strong> is improving. I'm only a little weird now. &#128514;</p>
        <p>I am allowing stranger's inside my circle. My circle is getting bigger.</p>
        <p>I still have a long way to go to improve personally. But hey...it won't happen overnight but it will happen.</p>
        <br>

      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

        <p>The values you have instilled within you are how you approach each learning process whilst programming.</p>
        <p>The empathy you show to yourself and others have an impact on you personally.</p>
        <p>Knowing your limits and the ability to push through them has an amazing feeling.</p>
        <br>
      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

        <p>It's some deep internal digging shit man. I like it.</p>
        <br>

      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

        <p>Listening and Looping. I really suck at both. I interrupt when I should be listening, and I talk quite fast so them listening to me...goodluck. &#129318;</p>
        <br>

      <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>

        <p>Beginning of Foundation's I thought it was quite weird and that it was to make us soft lil marshmallow people.</p>
        
        <p>Or maybe to make us employable in any industry not just in a coding industry but anywhere.</p>
        <br>

      <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>

        <p>Core learning is definately not a waste of time. Actually helps to give me a break from programming brain-mush.</p>
